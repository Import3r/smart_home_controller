# Simulation of a Smart Home Controller

## Description

This is a proteus simulation for a smart home control system utilizing a "PIC16f877" microcontroller, to achieve automated management of different aspects of the house, like temprature control and watering the garden, while introducing some handy features that the residents can make use of, such as energy saving through smart garage lights, an anti-burglar security system, and a user interface to view the sensor readings and toggle these systems on and off. The interface will also be password protected to ensure unauthorized access is prohibited.

This project is a part of a universite course on "Microprocessors and Embedded Systems".
